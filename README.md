# Machine-Learning-Projects

The global machine learning market is booming, owing in large part to all of the money being put into it by the worldâ€™s biggest corporations.Google Translate witnessed a 60% reduction in error rates after using a machine learning-powered translation engine.Around 80% of those who have used machine learning and artificial intelligence say their income has increased as a result of their use of these technologies.

Machine Learning is the important sector in the present and coming days. I have made some projects on Machinne Learning to implement some codes in python language. Some projects are listed below:

1. Sonar Prediction for Rock Vs Mine

      * Logistic Regression used.

2. Diabetes Prediction

      * SVM(Support Vector Machine) used
      * StandardScaler used for data standarization

3. House Price Prediction

      * XGBRegressor is used
      * sklearn dataset is used

4. Fake News Predictor 

      * Logistic Regressor is used
      * TfidfVectorizer is used for feature extraction
      * english stopwords is used
      * PorterStemmer is used for relating with rootwords

5. Loan Approval Predictor

      * SVM (Support Vector Machine) is used
      * seaborn is used for plotting graphs  

6. Wine Quality Predictor

     * RandomForestClassifier is used
     * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

7. Car Price Prediction

     * LinearRegression is used
     * Lasso is also used

8. Gold Price Predictor

    * RandomForestRegressor is used
    * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

9. Heart Disease Predictor

    * Logistic Regression is used

10. Credit Card Fraud Detector

    * Logistic Regression is used

11. Medical Price Predictor

    * LinearRegression is used
    * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

12. Big Mart Sales Prediction

    * XGBRegressor is used
    * LabelEncoder is used for processing
    * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

13. Customer Segmentation Prediction

    * Kmeans is used
    * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

14. Parkinson's Disease Prediction

    * SVM (Support Vector Machine ) is used
    * StandardScaler is used for standardization
   
15. Titanic Survival Prediction

   * LogisticRegression is used
   * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

16. Calories Burnt Prediction

   * XGBRegressor is used
   * matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn is used for plotting graphs

17. Spam Mail Prediction

   * LogisticRegression is used
   * TfidfVectorizer is used for feature extraction

18. Movie Recommendation System

   * cosine_similarity is used
   * difflib is used for closet mispelled mistake by user
   * TfidfVectorizer is used for feature extraction

19. Breast Cancer Prediction

   * LogisticRegression is used
   * sklearn dataset is used


I have used numpy library for creating arrays and pandas library for converting csv(comma separated value) to pandas dataframe. Metrics libray from sklearn for calculation part.

Accuracy Score is used for classifier model,i.e, for boolean values

While for Regression model for continuous data, we use R Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.
